            <h1>My Carear So Far</h1>
            <p>Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean start-ups and was a member of the first New Zealand
                start-up to attend Y Combinator, the largest start-up accelerator in the world. From there, I worked my
                way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw the design of 30+ mobile and desktop
                apps. Currently, I lead UI/UX design at SaaS start-up VideoMyJob.</p>

                <p>"Sebastian is a guru at all things UX design, consistently producing intuitive, modern, and bold
                    designs.
                    He is a natural problem solver in the design space so everyone went to him if they were stuck on a
                    feature or flow. He has a arsenal of design skills including animation and graphic design. Not to
                    mention, Seb was a design team lead, which means he managed a full team of both onshore and offshore
                    designs reviewing and providing feedback on all of their designs... Any business would be lucky to
                    have
                    him."</p>
